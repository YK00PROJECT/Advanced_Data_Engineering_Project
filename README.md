# Data Engineering Project Portfolio

## Overview
Welcome to my Data Engineering Project Portfolio! This repository contains a collection of projects showcasing my skills and expertise in managing and analyzing large datasets using a variety of tools and technologies including Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana, Hive, MongoDB, SparkSQL, and Hadoop. Each project is documented with a detailed report or presentation, offering insights into the objectives, processes, outcomes, and technical details.

## Repository Contents
This repository includes the following projects:

### Elastic_Search_Logstash_Kibana.pdf
- **Description:** A comprehensive report on implementing an ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) stack to collect, process, and visualize logs for real-time data analysis.

### Hive_HQL.zpln
- **Description:** A Zeppelin notebook containing HiveQL scripts used to perform data warehousing tasks on Hadoop, showcasing data manipulation, querying, and aggregation.

### MongoDB.pdf
- **Description:** A detailed report on using MongoDB for NoSQL database management, focusing on schema design, data aggregation, and performance optimization.

### Sparksql_Hadoop.zpln
- **Description:** A Zeppelin notebook demonstrating the use of SparkSQL on top of Hadoop for large-scale data processing, including data cleaning, transformation, and analytical queries.

### Summary_Report-Result.pdf
- **Description:** A summary report presenting the results and insights derived from the various data engineering tasks performed across different technologies.
